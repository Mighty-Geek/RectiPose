# RectiPose
This project is a one stop destination for yoga learners to get started.

### Overview
RectiPose is a web app to help novice yoga learners to get started with yoga. The project mainly focuses on 4 aspects which are finding, learning, calibration and analysis of yoga poses. With the help of this project we intend to deal with social challenges like poverty, health care inavailability, childhood obesity, bullying etc.
